## 🎯 Overview

AI API Testing is a powerful tool that leverages artificial intelligence to automatically generate, execute and validate test cases for:

- RESTful APIs
- GraphQL endpoints
- AI agent workflows and interactions
- Multi-agent systems

## ✨ Key Features

- **AI-Powered Test Generation**: Automatically creates comprehensive test suites based on API specifications and agent behaviors
- **Workflow Testing**: Validates complex interactions between multiple AI agents
- **Smart Assertions**: Intelligently verifies responses and state changes
- **Edge Case Discovery**: Uses AI to identify and test boundary conditions
- **Clear Reporting**: Generates detailed test reports with actionable insights

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
ai-api-testing ping
```

❗ WIP - Need more testing

```bash
ai-api-testing extract-specs
```
